# Geospatial Data Preprocessing Application

This is a Streamlit-based application designed to preprocess geospatial data from KML, Excel (.xlsx), or GeoJSON files and generate a detailed Excel report. The app processes Polygon and MultiPolygon geometries, removes duplicates, analyzes geometric properties, and handles overlaps to produce a cleaned dataset.

## Features
- Supports KML, Excel (.xlsx), and GeoJSON file formats.
- Processes `wkt_geom` column with Polygon or MultiPolygon geometries in WKT format.
- Generates an Excel report with the following sheets:
  - `all_data (count)`: All loaded data.
  - `geo_unique (count)`: Unique geometries (based on `wkt_geom`).
  - `geo_duplicates (count)`: Duplicate geometries.
  - `attr_duplicates (count)`: Duplicate Plantation Codes.
  - `attr_unique (count)`: Unique Plantation Codes.
  - `num_point (count)`: Geometries with fewer than 12 points.
  - `centroid (count)`: Geometries whose centroids are outside their boundaries.
  - `ovlp15 (count)`: Geometries from `geo_unique` overlapping by more than 15%, including Plantation Code, area in hectares (3 decimals), overall overlap percentage (2 decimals), and overlap percentage of each polygon relative to the other (2 decimals).
  - `valid (count)`: Filtered data starting from `geo_unique`, excluding duplicate attributes, polygons with external centroids, and removing overlapping polygons (>15%) based on area (smaller area removed; if equal, one is removed). Ensures no duplicates in geometries or attributes remain. Includes `area_ha` (3 decimals, 1 ha = 10,000 mÂ²), `longitude` (8 decimals), and `latitude` (8 decimals).
- Includes a progress bar during analysis.
- Offers language selection (English/French) for instructions and UI elements.
- Provides a downloadable Excel report named `geospatial_report_<filename>.xlsx`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
  - `streamlit`
  - `geopandas`
  - `shapely`
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mg7analytics/geospatial_app.git
   cd geospatial_app
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run geospatial_app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).
3. Select your preferred language (English or French) from the dropdown menu.
4. Upload a file (KML, Excel, or GeoJSON) containing the required columns:
   - `wkt_geom`: Column with WKT-formatted Polygon or MultiPolygon geometries.
   - `Plantation Code`: Column for attribute analysis.
5. Wait for the analysis to complete (progress bar will update).
6. Download the generated Excel report using the provided button.

## File Requirements
- The input file must include a `wkt_geom` column with valid WKT strings for Polygon or MultiPolygon geometries.
- The input file must include a `Plantation Code` column for attribute analysis.
- Supported formats: KML, Excel (.xlsx), GeoJSON.
- CRS (Coordinate Reference System) is assumed or set to EPSG:4326 (WGS84); areas are calculated in EPSG:3857 for consistency.

## Notes
- **Projection**: The app uses EPSG:3857 for area calculations to ensure consistency in overlap and area computations. For regional accuracy, consider using a local UTM zone if needed.
- **Overlap Removal**: In the `valid` sheet, overlapping polygons (>15%) are removed based on area comparison (smaller area is removed; if equal, the second polygon is removed arbitrarily).
- **Performance**: Large datasets with many overlapping polygons may take longer to process due to pairwise intersection checks.
